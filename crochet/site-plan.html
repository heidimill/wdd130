        Welcome to the Crochet Catalogue!

        Crochet is a great way to practice meditation while activating the creative part of your brain. A further benefit is the tangible product created by your own hands.

        I personally have just started crocheting. I find it so relaxing and calming. The repetitive motion of my hands gives me something to focus on without having to worry about stressful life problems. 

        This act of crocheting is a hobby surrounded by peace and vibrancy in the various results. Having a tangible physical result gives the brain satisfaction. Plus there is the added bonus of having a skill that translates into making home-made gifts for friends, family, and anyone who needs it.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        The following projects are beginner approved!

        Cat Beanie:
        This is a perfect first crochet project. Any yarn works well.
        This pattern can be found by searching "Crochet Cat Beanie" on YouTube.
        The materials needed are yarn, crochet hook (matching yarn recommendation), and a darning needle. 
        Total time: An hour and a half but could vary based on yarn weight.
        Difficulty: 2/5 Learning how to turn on rows can be diffeicult but overall there are only two stitched worked in a continuous rectangle shape.

        Hacky sacks:
        This pattern can be found searching hacky sack crochet pattern on google. 
        The materials needed are yarn, crochet hook (one size smaller than recommendation), darning needle, and dry pinto beans.
        Total time: An hour
        Difficulty: 4/5 Working in rounds is quite easy. Learning how to crochet an invisible decrease is a bit trickier but still doable. Crocheting around beans also provides a challenge

        Mushroom pops:
        This pattern is found on YouTube from "Cable and Canvas".
        The materials needed are  two yarn colors, crochet hook (one size smaller than recommendation), darning needle, polyfil, and safety eyes.
        Total time: An hour
        Difficulty: 5/5 For a brand new beginner, this pattern is quite difficult. Working around polyfil can add a level of confusion. As soon as the crafter has more experience with decreases, this pattern is more of a 3/5 difficulty level.

      <h3>Basic Information</h3>
      <p>
        As a beginner, sometimes it can be overwhelming to try to understand a lot of niche concepts. This page is meant to be a beginners guide.

        These are the things I wish I knew when I started crochet.

        Do different sized hooks really matter?

        Short answer: yes
        Some yarns do not respond well to smaller hooks and will begin to curl execively.
        The different sizes of hooks also create different size projects. 

        Inline vs tapered crochet hooks:

        For beginners, I suggest using inline hooks. They help with learning the yarn tension and will create more consistent stitches especially while first learning how to make the different stitches. The inline hook has a sharper point to insert between loops and a more consistent size throughout the hook with a deeper hook. The tapered hooks are more rounded and taper quite a bit near the hook.

        Darning needles and stitch markers:

        While regular sewing needles do work, sometimes it can be extremely difficult getting the yarn through the eye. Darning needles have a larger eye that is better for yarn and a duller tip that glides between the crochet stitches without catching. I recommend a darning needle.

        A stitch marker could be convenient however most of the time using a piece of scrap yarn works just as well.
